1a) Update de randomization on the treasures:
    - Key needs to be in there, every single time, once, in a random chest.
    - Compass needs to be in there, every single time, once, in a random chest.
    - Think of several new items to scatter around the chests.
    - Think of chest traps.
    - Build all this crap into the game.

1b) Create an interface function for the treasures:
    - Always the option to OPEN it or LEAVE it be. Opening it of course marks it as viewed on the map
    but is not mentioned when returning to the same room.
    - Once opened people need to see what happens or what you've picked up, so add a CONTINUE button
    so that people can continue the game.

1c) Create a "pause" function that I can use to disable all the controls and add a CONTINUE button at
    the end of whatever is in de text box.

2a) Update the weaponry randomization:
    - Add small armor, medium armor, big armor to the globalWeapons array.
    - Make randomize script for scattering these around.

2b) Create an interface function for the weapons:
    - This can be just a CONTINUE button so people can at least see what they've picked up.

3) Create the traps and make the randomization for it:
    - Create three small traps, disarm not possible.
    - Create three large traps, disarm not possible.
    - Create several special traps that require simple puzzle solving, and disarming them.
    - Create chav troll trap.

4) Add in the exit door at a random location somewhere around the sides.
    - CAN NOT BE A SOUTH WALL (because you can't see it).
    - Create randomization for the map generator to do this.

5) Update map generator with cue points:
    - Draw different dress-ups of rooms.
    - Think about whether you want to make separates for the corners
    - Randomize the cue points
    - Build in vulgar reference

6) Create a function for showing the rooms, corners and cue points:
    - If possible make two divs on top of each other so that the rooms are images and not backgrounds.
    - Figure out if possible to add sliding effects or fading or the likes to underline movement.

7) Add in "bum genie"
    - Condition: get scroll of monster+, get scroll of numpty, be robbed by chav troll.
    - Spawn a lamp somewhere when these conditions are met.
    - Give option to rub it, then the genie will ask you to rub his bum. Then a random outcome:
        * Outcome 1) Player gets riches and gold. Ends game.
        * Outcome 2) Damage or even kill the player with a firey fart.
        * Outcome 3) Nothing happens, game continues.
